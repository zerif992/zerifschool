      "House 5 at Carriages in Purley is a superb 1 bedroom house situated on the first floor. This stylish home is spread across approximately 658 sq ft of open-plan living space and features a modern specification throughout. Winner of the Best New Development in the Retirement Living sector, Carriages is a welcoming collection of one and two bedroom apartments exclusively for the over 60's located in the heart of Purley. The simple pleasures of home were a central point of reference in the community's design. The resulting apartments are light, spacious and welcoming, and some are equipped with private roof terraces or gardens. Architects Woods Bagot have created a five-storey building with exposed brickwork and bronze features that reference the community's location just south of the old tracks of the Surrey Iron Railway; for many years its horse-drawn carriages transported goods from the North Downs to the Thames. The landscapers also found inspiration in this railway heritage, creating borders of coarse stone beds and wildflowers. Surrounded by parkland and golf courses, Purley is a green and affluent district. With excellent transport links from East Croydon station, the M23 and A22, its easy to enjoy everything that London and the South East has to offer.",
